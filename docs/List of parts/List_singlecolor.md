Please note that the choice of objective dictates the adapters. 
In our case, we chose the objectives from **Yongnuo**(4), which requires the **SM1A2**(5) and **SM2A53**(6) adapters to connect with the cage and the camera.
However, if you choose the objectives from other vendors, such as **Canon**, the appropriate adapters would be [SM1A71](https://www.thorlabs.de/thorproduct.cfm?partnumber=SM1A71) and [SM2A26](https://www.thorlabs.de/thorproduct.cfm?partnumber=SM2A26), respectively.

Please note that, the linear stages **X-LHM150A** (19) have a maximum centered load of 30 N and maximum moment of 50 N⋅cm. 
If you decided to upgrade the setup to the dual color macroscope later on, this would not work as the light path of the dual color weighs roughly 2.2 kg and will produce moment of about 200 N⋅cm which exceeds the limit.
In that case, you should purchase the linear stages [**X-LSM150A**](https://www.zaber.com/products/linear-stages/X-LHM/specs?part=X-LHM150A) directly.
