# Defaults and pre-sets
To allow efficiency when starting up, users can define default settings and configurations that will be preloaded whenever the GUI starts.

**Camera:** In settings, select the default camera settings (.pfs) file that will be loaded on startup

**Stage:** In settings, select a starting location for the stage and toggle on â€˜start location;. The stage will move to those coordinates upon startup.

**Recording:** Change recording path and parameters such as frame rate and duration. The latest settings will be loaded upon GUI start.
