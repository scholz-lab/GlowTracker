# Macro Script

The Macro Script feature allows the user to write a small, customized script to control the GlowTracker directly. 
This can help automatize some of the repetitive tasks that you may want to perform, such as moving the stage in a predefined pattern and taking images along the way. 
The Macro Script supports 7 predefined commands, a loop control, variable assignment, and simple arithmetic. 
The grammar is aimed to be simple and familiar just like a normal programming language. 
Users can start using the feature by opening the Macro Script window at **Settings > Macro**.

## Commands
### move_abs(x, y, z)
Move the stage to a given absolute coordinate.
